# carlos-bernard.github.io
A portfolio website made to compliment my resume.
It is intended to be updated and added to over time as i complete new learning milestones and practice projects that are worthy enough to potentially interest potential employers.

Github pages are static and do not support server side languages like PHP so Formspree has been used to make the contact forms functional.

The web page has been created by editing a bootstrap provided by Themefisher. Their Github and the original bootstrap can be found at https://github.com/themefisher/
